# Thesis repository Sebastiaan Hermans

Authored by Sebastiaan Hermans, from the MSc Applied Physics at Delft University of Technology. In this repository part of the codes can be found that were written and used as a part of my thesis project, titled "Efficiently coupling QM and MD for the study of electrode-electrolyte interfaces". 

`Bicarbonate-Carbondioxide` Folder containing files for running a LAMMPS simulation of a system containing bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, potassium and water. 

`Carbon` Folder containing all files required to run a coupled LAMMPS/DFTB+ simulation of an carbon electrode-electrolyte interface.

`Copper` In this folder all files required to run a coupled LAMMPS/DFTB+ simulation of an copper electrode-electrolyte interface can befound. 

`Neural_Networks` Folder containing some of the (examples of) files used during the machine learning part of the project.

`Umbrella_Sampling` This folder contains files that can be used for performing umbrella sampling.

`AP_MSc_Thesis_Sebastiaan_Hermans.pdf` The final version of the thesis.
