This folder contains files for running a LAMMPS simulation of
a system containing bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, potassium and 
water. 

Bicarbonate was modelled using the LigParGen generator using the
SMILES code of bicarbonate. Carbon dioxide was modelled using Cygan
et al. (2012). Potassium was modelled using Joung and Cheatham (2008)
and the SPC/E was the water model that was used.
